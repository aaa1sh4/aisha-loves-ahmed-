    <p>
"Happy birthday my love<3, my baby, my sweet boy, my love, my beautiful boy, my gorgeous, my sweet, my adorable, my handsome, my lovely, my charming, my genius, my loyal, my kind, my precious loving husband, sometimes I wonder if words will ever be enough to hold the size of my love for you, but here I am trying anyway, spilling my heart in every sentence, every line, every breath, because you deserve every word and more <3, and if it takes me days to tell you just how much I adore you, then I would gladly spend my whole life writing you letters this long and still feel like I haven’t said enough You are the most precious part of my world, and though we’ve never met in person yet, you’ve managed to become my everything, the center of my thoughts, the warmth in my heart, the softest dream I carry everywhere with me I love when you tell me stories before I fall asleep, when your voice becomes the lullaby that calms me and carries me into dreams, when I can almost imagine your arms around me even if you’re miles away, and in those moments I never feel alone, because I have you, always you<3 I love when you sing randomly while we’re on a call, when you don’t even notice how magical your voice sounds, when you think you’re just being casual but to me it feels like the sweetest melody made only for me, and I cherish it so much, like a little secret concert that lives in my memory forever<3 I love when you do something in a call that you call “cringe,” because to me it never is, not even close, my baby, it’s the opposite it makes me smile so much, it makes me giggle, it makes me fall deeper in love with you, because everything you do, every silly or serious thing, is beautiful to me, because it’s you And my love, my sweet boy, I love when you randomly tell me “I love you so much” out of nowhere, when I least expect it, when it just bursts out of your heart, and it makes mine skip a beat every time, like I’ve just been kissed by sunshine, like the whole world pauses to let me soak in the warmth of you <3 I melt when you’re romantic with me, when you say the most beautiful things about me, when you make me blush and smile like an idiot in love, and I keep those words with me like treasures, replaying them whenever I miss you, which is always I am proud of you, Ahmed, my baby, my love, I am so proud of you, more than I can put into words, proud of everything you have done for yourself, for me, and for our future, proud of your strength, proud of your kindness, proud of the way you carry your heart, and proud of the way you love me <3 I love, love, love when you call me yosha my favorite nickname, the one that makes me instantly light up, the one that makes me feel like I belong to you in the most special way, the one I will never get tired of hearing <3 I love how you tell me my laughter sounds really cute, how you make me love a part of myself I used to dislike, how you became the very first person to make me truly love my smile before you, I hated it, but now I find myself smiling in every picture I take, smiling just for you, because knowing that you adore it makes me adore it too <3 You changed the way I see myself, my sweet boy, and that is one of the most beautiful gifts you could have ever given me, and I will never stop thanking you in my heart for it I imagine us one day meeting, my love, my beautiful boy, and I dream about running into your arms, about finally hearing your heartbeat not through a call but against my ear, about holding your hand and never letting go, about seeing your smile with my own eyes and knowing it’s mine, and I know when that day comes it will be the most magical moment of my life, the moment when all the waiting, all the distance, all the longing will be worth it a thousand times over <3 Until that day, I will keep loving you endlessly, I will keep cherishing your stories, your songs, your so-called “cringe” moments, your sudden “I love you’s,” your romantic words, your beautiful soul, because everything about you is my joy, my baby, my sweet boy, my love, my beautiful boy, my everything <3 I will keep writing you endless letters like this, I will keep smiling in pictures just for you, I will keep laughing knowing you think it’s cute, I will keep carrying the sound of your voice in my heart like the sweetest song, I will keep holding onto every memory we make across this distance until the day I can hold you for real, You are my favorite person in this universe, Ahmed, my safe place, my light, my comfort, my dream, and my forever <3, and I love you more than I will ever, ever be able to explain, but I will never stop trying, because my love for you is infinite, and it belongs to you completely, now and always, i'll love you till the day i die, i'll do all my best to keep you happy and protected as long as i'm here i'll stand by you through every high and every low, i'll hold onto you in every storm, i'll celebrate you in every victory, i'll
